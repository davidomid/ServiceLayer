# ServiceLayer
A C# library for developing SOLID services with consistent error handling. 

## What can this library do for me? 

This library can dramatically simplify your error handling logic across your projects and allow you to write code in a truly SOLID way.

### Example code

Say you have a service class which looks like this. 
```csharp

```


## Installation

ServiceLayer is available as a NuGet package: 

```
Install-Package ServiceLayer
```

### ASP.NET Core integration

Some useful features for integrating ServiceLayer with ASP.NET Core applications is also available as a separate NuGet package: 

```
Install-Package ServiceLayer.Core
```
