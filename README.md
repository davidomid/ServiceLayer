## What's ServiceLayer? 
ServiceLayer is a C# library for developing SOLID services with consistent error handling. 

This library allows you to implement [the service layer design pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/serviceLayer.html) extremely easily, by removing all of the pitfalls and antipatterns which many developers encounter when implementing it.

If you find yourself using a service layer architecture in C#, this is the perfect library for you. If you're not using this design pattern, you should still consider using this library. 

**Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/davidomid/ServiceLayer/wiki) for full documentation and usage examples.**
